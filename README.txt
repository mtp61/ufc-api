My api is taking UFC data to make predictions on whether the red or blue fighter won the fight based on the number of landed body shots for each fighter. I thought it was interesting to give the probability that the network thought as well as a prediction. This can give some insight into how much it matters for a fighter to punch more and how much it matters.
